# ðŸ§  Employee Burnout Prediction and Analysis

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
Employee burnout is a growing challenge in organizations, affecting productivity, satisfaction, and retention.  
This project focuses on **analyzing HR and workplace data** to predict the likelihood of employee burnout using **machine learning and statistical analysis**.

By cleaning, visualizing, and modeling employee data, this project helps uncover key patterns between **workload, mental fatigue, satisfaction, and performance**, supporting **data-driven HR decisions**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Analyze HR datasets to identify trends and correlations contributing to burnout.
- Build and compare predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluate performance through error metrics and accuracy scores.
- Provide actionable insights to support employee well-being and retention.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Imported HR dataset containing metrics such as working hours, stress level, job satisfaction, and mental fatigue.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values, standardized formats, and normalized numerical columns using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generated descriptive statistics and correlation matrices.
   - Created visualizations (heatmaps, bar plots, histograms) to identify burnout-related features.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selected relevant variables impacting burnout (e.g., workload, satisfaction level).
   - Encoded categorical features if applicable.

5. **Model Building**
   - Implemented multiple regression and ensemble models:
     - Linear Regression  
     - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
     - Random Forest Regressor

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compared models using:
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
     - RÂ² Score  
     - ROC-AUC for classification aspects

7. **Insights & Results**
   - Identified top predictors of burnout.
   - Derived insights for HR teams to improve employee satisfaction and reduce risk of burnout.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results
- Best-performing model: **Random Forest Regressor** (highest RÂ², lowest MAE)
- Identified top burnout indicators: **high workload**, **low satisfaction**, **mental fatigue**
- Delivered visualization-driven insights on employee wellness trends
